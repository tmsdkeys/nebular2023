  "description": "Ultimately Polymer will place itself as an IBC router hub in between two chains wanting to connect over IBC. For this, it relies on the multi-hop IBC specification that ensures that chains can send packets over IBC between one another despite them not having a direct IBC connection, instead leveraging multiple hops where IBC connections do already exist.",
